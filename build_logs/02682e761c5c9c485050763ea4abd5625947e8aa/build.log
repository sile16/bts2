CMake Warning (dev) at libraries/fc/vendor/websocketpp/CMakeLists.txt:229 (add_subdirectory):
  The source directory

    /build/graphene/libraries/fc/vendor/websocketpp/test

  does not contain a CMakeLists.txt file.

  CMake does not support this case but it used to work accidentally and is
  being allowed for compatibility.

  Policy CMP0014 is not set: Input directories must have CMakeLists.txt.  Run
  "cmake --help-policy CMP0014" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
